# SANA-Project

The SANA project's goal is to create a Islamic-specific database for research purposes. My contribution to this goal is to create a model that would predict category based on Abstract and Title. 

In order to accomplish this, I have currently divided the work with taking removig no punctuation and removing punctuation to see the overall noise difference it creates. 

Next Steps: 
1) Create a dictionary or import a list of arabic names for grouping. Ex: Mohammed and Mohamad --> Mohammad 
2) Include removing some punctuation vs others 
3) Write machine learning classifiers as a pipeline
